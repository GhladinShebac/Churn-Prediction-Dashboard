📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Recommender

An end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to identify high-risk customers and provide automated, data-driven retention strategies to maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

🚀 Project Overview
In the retail industry, retaining an existing customer is significantly cheaper than acquiring a new one. This project utilizes transactional data to proactively predict which customers are likely to stop shopping (churn) and suggests specific marketing interventions based on their historical value.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Machine Learning: XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Evaluation: Scikit-learn (Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)

Deployment: Streamlit (Web Dashboard)

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Online Retail

🧠 Key Features & Workflow
1. Data Engineering & RFM Analysis
Transformed 500,000+ raw transaction records into a customer-centric dataset by calculating RFM metrics:

Recency: Days since the last purchase.

Frequency: Total number of transactions.

Monetary: Total revenue generated by the customer.

2. Predictive Modeling
Defined "Churn" using a threshold based on Recency (Customers who haven't purchased in >60 days).

Trained an XGBoost Classifier to recognize patterns in buying behavior.

Engineered features such as Average Order Value (AOV) and Product Diversity to improve model accuracy from baseline.

3. Automated Retention Engine
Implemented a rule-based logic system that recommends actions based on the predicted risk:

VIP Recovery: Personal outreach + high-tier discounts for high-spending at-risk customers.

Loyalty Boost: Re-engagement campaigns for previously frequent shoppers.

Standard Nurture: Automated newsletter updates for low-risk active customers.
